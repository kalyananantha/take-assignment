# In this respository we have both client and server(node.js) side applications

**Required**
Node.js should be installed before in your local machine

## Client-side:

1. Clone this repository into your local machine using https with git clone
2. After successsfully cloned go to `client` folder of this project
3. Then open the `command/powershell` prompt in your machine
4. Now, you are in `client` folder so install the client side node-modules by using `npm install`
5. After installing run the command to up the front-end server by using `npm run dev`

## Server-side:

# Now you have to setup the server in your local to work with client

1. In the same repository we have `server` folder under the `client` folder
2. So open new `command/powershell` prompt from the `server` folder
3. Now, install the server side node-modules by using `npm install`
4. Once it's done, now run the command `npm start` to start the server in node.js
5. Now ready to use the server on port `http://localhost:3000`

## Now client side you can run on `http://localhost:5173/`

# To run the unit test run the command `npm run test:unit`
